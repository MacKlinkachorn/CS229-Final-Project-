This repository contains code for machine learnign models that were built to predict the chaotic nature of a double pendulum. The linear regression and autogregressive models were applied towards double pendulums with smaller initial angles while the feed forward neural network and LSTM were mainly applied toward initial conditions with large angles. 

To run the LSTM2 model, first run the createCSV file, all other files should be ready to run otherwise.
